About
=====

Peak-finder has been designed for the detection and grouping of time-domain
electromagnetic (TEM) anomalies measured along flight lines. Anomaly markers
can be exported to `Geoscience ANALYST <https://www.mirageoscience.com/mining-industry-software/geoscience-analyst/>`_,
along with various metrics for characterization and targeting.

* Amplitude
* Dip direction
* Mad Tau (TEM data only)
* Anomaly skewness

While initially designed for TEM data, the same application can be used for
characterization of anomalies of mixed data types (eg. magnetics, gravity,
topography, etc..).
