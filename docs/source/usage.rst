User interface
==============

The main entry point is the ui.json (stored under peak-finder-assets) for the peak-finder application that can be rendered by Geoscience ANALYST. The interface has two sections:

 - :ref:`General Parameters <General Parameters>` (required)
 - :ref:`Optional Parameters <Optional Parameters>`

ui.json interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ui.json interface has two sections:

.. _General Parameters:

1. General Parameters
_____________________

The general parameters must be set before running the application, regardless of
the mode of operation.

- *Object*: Curve entity containing the data and line ID information.
- *Line Field*: [Optional] Referenced data defining the line identifier. If omitted, the line ID
  is inferred from the unique curve parts.
- *Property Group*: Property group data to be used in the detection and grouping. To add more groups, see
  the :ref:`Optional Parameters <grouping parameters>` section.
- *Color*: Hex color code used to label the peaks identified. A default value is provided that will
  suffice in most cases.
- *Save as*: Name of the output group holding the results.
- *Export all markers*: If selected, all markers will be exported to the output group. If not selected,
  only the peak group centers will be exported.
- *Create trend lines*: If selected, trend lines are created connecting the peak group centers across survey lines. See
  the `Trend Line <https://mirageoscience-curve-apps.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/trend_lines.html#trend-lines>`_
  documentation page for more information.
- *Run interactive app*: If selected, the ui.json parameters will be
  used to initialize an interactive application.  In this mode, any changes made
  through the ui will override the values set in the ui.json.  Without the
  *run interactive app* checkbox selected, the application will be run in a terminal
  with the parameters set in the ui.json (standalone mode).

.. _Optional Parameters:

2. Optional Parameters
______________________


These parameters are required to run in :ref:`Standalone <standalone_application>`, but not necessary to run the application in :ref:`Interactive <interactive_application>` mode.

Note that the group parameters have no equivalent in the interactive application,
and must be set in the optional parameters tab.  If a user wishes to find peaks in more
than one group of time channels, say, they must add the groups here.

.. _grouping parameters:

   Groups can be added by checking the box to enable and selecting a property group and
   color representation.

To learn more about the algorithm and its parameters, see the :ref:`methodology <methodology>`
section.  To see how the parameters are exposed in each of the application modes visit the
:ref:`interactive <interactive_application>` and :ref:`standalone <standalone_application>`
